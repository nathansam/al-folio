Our current ability to characterise heterogeneity in Crohn's disease is based on
surgical outcomes, hospitalisations, and Montreal disease progression.

In this study, we used longitudinal trajectories of faecal calprotectin, a
biomarker for gastrointestinal inflammation, to describe heterogeneity in
Crohn's disease.

We found four clusters of Crohn's disease patients. Cluster membership was
associated with early biologic treatment, smoking status at diagnosis, and upper
gastrointestinal involvement. The largest of these clusters demonstrated 
consistently high faecal calprotectin and were less likely to have received
early biologic treatment.

Crohnâ€™s disease patients appear to belong to distinct subgroups based on faecal
calprotectin profiles. Instead of only utilising clinical endpoints, considering
faecal calprotectin over time allows an inflammation-driven approach to
classification and may enable risk stratification in the future.
