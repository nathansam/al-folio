PREdiCCt (The PRognostic effect of Environmental factors in Crohn’s and Colitis)
is a UK-wide cohort study investigating which environmental, genetic, and
microbial factors are associated with disease flare in patients with Crohn’s
disease, ulcerative colitis, and inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU).

Patients were recruited after being in remission for at least two months. During
recruitment, participants completed initial questionnaires. Shortly after
recruitment, patients completed lifestyle and environmental questionnaires and a
four-day weighed food diary via a web-portal. Saliva and stool samples for
genetic and microbial analysis respectively were sent in by participants.
The stool sample is also used to measure gut inflammation by using faecal
calprotectin levels.

The progress of patients is then monitored over two years. Participants are
asked to complete monthly questionnaires through the web-portal. If a
participant experiences a flare then they are asked to notify the PREdiCCt team
and provide an additional stool sample.

How the environmental and microorganism factors recorded at the time of the
flare differ with the baseline data is of interest to this study. The difference
in baseline measurements between those who flare and those who do not will also
be investigated.

As a member of the statistical analysis committee, I have provided statistical
insights for the main analysis. I am also using this date to model IBD outcomes
over time using longitudinally collected data.
