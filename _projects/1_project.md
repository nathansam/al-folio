`datefixR` is designed to standardize messy date data, such as dates
entered by different people via text boxes, by converting the dates to
Râ€™s Date data type.

This package arose from my own fights with messy date data where dates
were written in many different formats e.g 01-jan-15, 2015 04 02,
10/12/2010 and more.

## Installation instructions

`datefixR` is now available on CRAN.

{% highlight r %}
install.packages("datefixR")
{% endhighlight %}


The most up-to-date (hopefully) stable version of `datefixR` can be
installed via

{% highlight r %}
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nathansam/fixdateR")
{% endhighlight %}

If you wish to live on the cutting edge of `datefixR` development, then
the development version can be installed via

{% highlight r %}
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nathansam/datefixR", "devel")
{% endhighlight %}

### Usage

{% highlight r %}
library(datefixR)
bad.dates <- data.frame(id = seq(5),
                        some.dates = c("02/05/92",
                                       "01-04-2020",
                                       "1996/05/01",
                                       "2020-05-01",
                                       "02-04-96"),
                        some.more.dates = c("2015",
                                            "02/05/00",
                                            "05/1990",
                                            "2012-08",
                                            "jan 2020")
                        )
fixed.df <- fix_dates(bad.dates, c("some.dates", "some.more.dates"))
knitr::kable(fixed.df)
{% endhighlight %}

|  id | some.dates | some.more.dates |
|----:|:-----------|:----------------|
|   1 | 1992-05-02 | 2015-07-01      |
|   2 | 2020-04-01 | 2000-05-02      |
|   3 | 1996-05-01 | 1990-05-01      |
|   4 | 2020-05-01 | 2012-08-01      |
|   5 | 1996-04-02 | 2020-01-01      |

By default, `datefixR` imputes missing days of the month as 01, and
missing months as 07 (July). However, this behavior can be modified via
the `day.impute` or `month.impute` arguments.

{% highlight r %}
 example.df <- data.frame(example = "1994")

fix_dates(example.df, "example", month.impute = 1)
#>      example
#> 1 1994-01-01
{% endhighlight %}

Functions in `datefixR` assume day-first instead of month-first when
day, month, and year are all given (unless year is given first). However
this behavior can be modified by passing `format = "mdy"` to function
calls.

### Limitations

The package is written solely in R and seems fast enough for my current
use cases (a few hundred rows). However, I may convert the core for loop
to C++ in the future if I (or others) need it to be faster.

### Citation

If you use this package in your research, please consider citing
`datefixR`! An up-to-date citation can be obtained by running
