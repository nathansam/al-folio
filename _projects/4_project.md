I have previously worked on [DECOVID](http://decovid.org), a national
collaboration led by the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk), which
seeks to apply data science techniques to COVID-19 intensive care data to answer
pressing clinical questions which have arisen as a result of the disease
outbreak. 

During my time working on DECOVID, I co-presented presentations on survival
analysis to both the Edinburgh team working on DECOVID as well as the larger
DECOVID community. I also co-wrote a highly detailed statistical analysis plan.
