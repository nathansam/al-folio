You are a data scientist living your best life:
"[I have the sexiest job of the 21<sup>st</sup> century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)"
you mutter under your breath as you work. Then tragedy strikes.
That new dataset you just received? It has date data. And not just any date
data- date data which has been provided by a free-text web form. You scroll
through the data, the dates are in many different formats: day of the month
first, year first, - or / separators, month given as an abbreviation or in full.
"This is going to be a nightmare to standardise" you think to yourself. This is
decidedly *unsexy*. 

Fortunately, this is where the datefixR R package comes in. In a single function
call, all of these date data can be standardised into one format. datefixR's
[`fix_dates()`](https://www.constantine-cooke.com/datefixR/reference/fix_dates.html) function takes a dataframe (or tibble) object and the names of
any columns with date data and returns a dataframe object where the selected
columns have been standardised and converted to R's built-in `Date` class
(which follows the
[ISO 8601 format](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html)). If 
there are any dates which cannot be resolved, an error will be raised providing
the date and associated ID (assumed to be the first column if not explicitly
provided). 

Congratulations! You have potentially just saved yourself a whole lot of time.
Now you can run the analysis you actually want to do!

datefixR is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=datefixR).

## FAQs
* **Q:** Is the US date standard (month-first) supported? <br>
  **A** Yes! Just provide the argument `format = "mdy"`when calling
[`fix_dates()`](https://www.constantine-cooke.com/datefixR/reference/fix_dates.html)


* **Q:** Can I just standardise a single date? <br>
  **A** Yes! Just use the [`fix_date()`](https://www.constantine-cooke.com/datefixR/reference/fix_date.html)
  function. Please note that this might be slightly slower in a `for` loop than
  when using `fix_dates()`.
