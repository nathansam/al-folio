## Ed-DaSH



I am an instructor/helper for [Ed-Dash workshops](https://edcarp.github.io/Ed-DaSH/): Carpentry-style workshops which teach data science to those with health/bioscience backgrounds. 

I have instructed on [Introduction to Statistics with R](https://edcarp.github.io/2022-01-17_ed-dash_intro-statistics/) which introduces
statistical thinking and linear regression in R.
