## Ed-DaSH

I am an instructor/helper for [Ed-Dash workshops](https://edcarp.github.io/Ed-DaSH/): Carpentry-style workshops which teach data science to those with health/bioscience backgrounds. 

I have instructed on [Introduction to Statistics with R](https://edcarp.github.io/2022-01-17_ed-dash_intro-statistics/) which introduces
statistical thinking and linear regression in R and [High-Dimensional Statistics with R](https://edcarp.github.io/2022-05-17_ed-dash_high-dim-stats/) which teaches statistical and computational methods applicable to the high-dimensional data commonly found in biomedical science.
