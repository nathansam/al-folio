I am a postdoctoral research associate in health data science with interested
in modelling longitudinal biomarker trajectories and disease outcomes for
inflammatory bowel disease. I am in the [Lees group](https://charlielees.com) in
the
[Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine](https://www.ed.ac.uk/centre-genomic-medicine)
and in the
[Vallejos group](https://vallejosgroup.github.io) in the
[MRC Human Genetics Unit](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit). 

My research interests include longitudinal modelling, survival analysis,
electronic health records, and machine learning.

I am also an R package developer. My packages can be found on
[GitHub](https://www.github.com/nathansam).

In my personal life, I enjoy swimming, the gym, playing bass guitar, and all
things technology.
