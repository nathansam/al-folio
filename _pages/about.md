I am a Precision Medicine PhD student specialising in modelling biomarker
trajectories and disease outcomes - in particular for inflammatory bowel
disease. I am in the [Vallejos group](https://vallejosgroup.github.io) and
collaborate closely with clinical colleagues in the
[Lees group](https://charlielees.com). 

I have interests in survival analysis, electronic health records,
Bayesian statistics, and machine learning.

I am also an R package developer. My packages can be found on
[GitHub](www.github.com/nathansam).
