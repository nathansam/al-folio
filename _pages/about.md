I am a Precision Medicine PhD student specialising in modelling biomarker
trajectories and disease outcomes for inflammatory bowel
disease. I am in the [Vallejos group](https://vallejosgroup.github.io) and
collaborate closely with clinical colleagues in the
[Lees group](https://charlielees.com). 

My research interests include survival analysis, electronic health records,
Bayesian statistics, and machine learning.

I am also an R package developer. My packages can be found on
[GitHub](https://www.github.com/nathansam).

In my personal life, I enjoy swimming, the gym, and all things technology.
