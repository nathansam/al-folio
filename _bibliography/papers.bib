abstract = {Background and aims: Tofacitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi)
recently approved for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis
(UC) based on robust efficacy and safety data derived from OCTAVE clinical
trials. Evidence on the outcomes of tofacitinib therapy in real-world UC
patients is needed, as a number of these patients would be deemed ineligible for
clinical trials. We have therefore summarised data derived from observational,
real-world evidence (RWE) studies on the effectiveness and safety of tofacitinib
in moderate to severe UC patients.
Methods: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane
databases for observational studies on the use of tofacitinib in UC patients,
published between 30 May 2018 and 24 January 2021. Pooled induction (8–14 weeks)
and maintenance (16–26 weeks) clinical response and remission rates were
calculated, as well as the proportion of reported adverse events using random
effects models.
Results: Nine studies were included, comprising 830 patients, of which 81\%
were previously treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and 57\% with
vedolizumab. Induction of clinical response and remission were achieved in 51\%
(95\% confidence interval, 41–60\%) and 37\% (26–45\%) of patients, after a
median follow-up of 8 weeks. At the end of a median follow-up of 24 weeks,
maintenance of clinical response and remission were met in 40\% (31–50\%) and
29\% (23–36\%) of patients, respectively. Thirty-two percent of the patients had
at least one adverse event, the most commonly reported being mild infection
(13\%) and worsening of UC, requiring colectomy (13\%). A third of the patients
(35\%) discontinued tofacitinib, most frequently due to primary non-response
(51\%). 
Conclusion: Tofacitinib is a safe and effective therapy in real-world UC
patients, as previously reported by clinical trials.}

abstract = {Background and aims: Multiple adalimumab [ADA] biosimilars are now
approved for use in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]; however, effectiveness and
safety data remain scarce. We aimed to investigate long-term outcomes of the ADA
biosimilar SB5 in IBD patients following a switch from the ADA originator
[SB5-switch cohort] or after start of SB5 [SB5-start cohort].
Methods: We performed an observational cohort study in a tertiary IBD referral
centre. All IBD patients treated with Humira underwent an elective switch to
SB5. We identified all these patients in a biological prescription database that
prospectively registered all ADA start and stop dates including brand names.
Data on IBD phenotype, C-reactive protein [CRP], drug persistence, ADA drug and
antibody levels, and faecal calprotectin were collected.
Results: In total, 481 patients were treated with SB5, 256 in the SB5-switch
cohort (median follow-up: 13.7 months [IQR 8.6-15.2]) and 225 in the SB5-start
cohort [median follow-up: 8.3 months [4.2-12.8]). Of the SB5-switch cohort,
70.8% remained on SB5 beyond 1 year; 90/256 discontinued SB5, mainly due to
adverse events [46/90] or secondary loss of response [37/90]. In the SB5-start
cohort, 81/225 discontinued SB5, resulting in SB5-drug persistence of 60.3%
beyond 1 year. No differences in clinical remission [p = 0.53], CRP [p = 0.80],
faecal calprotectin [p = 0.40] and ADA trough levels [p = 0.55] were found
between baseline, week 26 and week 52 following switch. Injection site pain was
the most frequently reported adverse event.
Conclusion: Switching from ADA originator to SB5 appeared effective and safe in
this study with over 12 months of follow-up.}
