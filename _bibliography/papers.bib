        abstract = {Abstract Background Switching from originator infliximab (IFX) to biosimilar IFX is effective and safe. However, data on multiple switching are scarce. The Edinburgh inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) unit has undertaken three switch programmes: (1) Remicade to CT-P13 (2016), (2) CT-P13 to SB2 (2020), and (3) SB2 to CT-P13 (2021). Objective The primary endpoint of this study was to assess CT-P13 persistence following switch from SB2. Secondary endpoints included persistence stratified by the number of biosimilar switches (single, double and triple), effectiveness and safety. Methods We performed a prospective, observational, cohort study. All adult IBD patients on IFX biosimilar SB2 underwent an elective switch to CT-P13. Patients were reviewed in a virtual biologic clinic with protocol driven collection of clinical disease activity, C-reactive protein (CRP), faecal calprotectin (FC), IFX trough/antibody levels, and drug survival. Results 297 patients (CD n = 196 [66\%], ulcerative colitis/inflammatory bowel disease unclassified n = 101, [34\%]) were switched (followed-up: 7.5 months [6.8–8.1]). This was the third, second and first IFX switch for 67/297 (22.5\%), 138/297 (46.5\%) and 92/297 (31\%) of the cohort respectively. 90.6\% of patients remained on IFX during follow-up. The number of switches was not independently associated with IFX persistence after adjusting for confounders. Clinical (p = 0.77), biochemical (CRP ≤5 mg/ml; p = 0.75) and faecal biomarker (FC<250 µg/g; p = 0.63) remission were comparable at baseline, week 12 and week 24. Conclusion Multiple successive switches from IFX originator to biosimilars are effective and safe in patients with IBD, irrespective of the number of IFX switches.}

abstract = {Background and aims: Tofacitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi)
recently approved for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis
(UC) based on robust efficacy and safety data derived from OCTAVE clinical
trials. Evidence on the outcomes of tofacitinib therapy in real-world UC
patients is needed, as a number of these patients would be deemed ineligible for
clinical trials. We have therefore summarised data derived from observational,
real-world evidence (RWE) studies on the effectiveness and safety of tofacitinib
in moderate to severe UC patients.
Methods: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane
databases for observational studies on the use of tofacitinib in UC patients,
published between 30 May 2018 and 24 January 2021. Pooled induction (8-14 weeks)
and maintenance (16-26 weeks) clinical response and remission rates were
calculated, as well as the proportion of reported adverse events using random
effects models.
Results: Nine studies were included, comprising 830 patients, of which 81\%
were previously treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and 57\% with
vedolizumab. Induction of clinical response and remission were achieved in 51\%
(95\% confidence interval, 41-60\%) and 37\% (26-45\%) of patients, after a
median follow-up of 8 weeks. At the end of a median follow-up of 24 weeks,
maintenance of clinical response and remission were met in 40\% (31-50\%) and
29\% (23-36\%) of patients, respectively. Thirty-two percent of the patients had
at least one adverse event, the most commonly reported being mild infection
(13\%) and worsening of UC, requiring colectomy (13\%). A third of the patients
(35\%) discontinued tofacitinib, most frequently due to primary non-response
(51\%). 
Conclusion: Tofacitinib is a safe and effective therapy in real-world UC
patients, as previously reported by clinical trials.}

abstract = {Background and aims: Multiple adalimumab [ADA] biosimilars are now
approved for use in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]; however, effectiveness and
safety data remain scarce. We aimed to investigate long-term outcomes of the ADA
biosimilar SB5 in IBD patients following a switch from the ADA originator
[SB5-switch cohort] or after start of SB5 [SB5-start cohort].
Methods: We performed an observational cohort study in a tertiary IBD referral
centre. All IBD patients treated with Humira underwent an elective switch to
SB5. We identified all these patients in a biological prescription database that
prospectively registered all ADA start and stop dates including brand names.
Data on IBD phenotype, C-reactive protein [CRP], drug persistence, ADA drug and
antibody levels, and faecal calprotectin were collected.
Results: In total, 481 patients were treated with SB5, 256 in the SB5-switch
cohort (median follow-up: 13.7 months [IQR 8.6-15.2]) and 225 in the SB5-start
cohort [median follow-up: 8.3 months [4.2-12.8]). Of the SB5-switch cohort,
70.8% remained on SB5 beyond 1 year; 90/256 discontinued SB5, mainly due to
adverse events [46/90] or secondary loss of response [37/90]. In the SB5-start
cohort, 81/225 discontinued SB5, resulting in SB5-drug persistence of 60.3%
beyond 1 year. No differences in clinical remission [p = 0.53], CRP [p = 0.80],
faecal calprotectin [p = 0.40] and ADA trough levels [p = 0.55] were found
between baseline, week 26 and week 52 following switch. Injection site pain was
the most frequently reported adverse event.
Conclusion: Switching from ADA originator to SB5 appeared effective and safe in
this study with over 12 months of follow-up.}

  abstract = {Background and Aims: The progressive nature of Crohn's disease is
  highly variable and hard to predict. In addition, symptoms correlate poorly
  with mucosal inflammation. There is therefore an urgent need to better
  characterise the heterogeneity of disease trajectories in Crohn's disease by
  utilising objective markers of inflammation. We aimed to better understand
  this heterogeneity by clustering Crohn's disease patients with similar
  longitudinal faecal calprotectin profiles. Methods Latent class mixed models
  were used to model faecal calprotectin trajectories within five years of
  diagnosis and to cluster subjects. Information criteria, alluvial plots, and
  cluster trajectories were used to decide the optimal number of clusters.
  Chi-squared, Fisher's exact test, and ANOVA were used to test for associations
  with variables commonly assessed at diagnosis.
  
  Results: Our study cohort comprised of 365 patients with newly diagnosed
  Crohn's disease and 2856 faecal calprotectin measurements taken within five
  years of diagnosis (median 7 per subject). Four distinct clusters were
  identified by characteristic calprotectin profiles: a cluster with
  consistently high faecal calprotectin and three clusters characterised by
  different downward longitudinal trends. Cluster membership was significantly
  associated with smoking (p = 0.015), upper gastrointestinal involvement
  (p < 0.001), and early biologic therapy (p < 0.001).
  
  Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates a novel approach to characterising the
  heterogeneity of Crohn's disease by using faecal calprotectin. The group
  profiles do not simply reflect different treatment regimes and do not mirror
  classical disease progression endpoints. We believe these profiles represent
  an entirely new way of classifying disease behaviour in Crohn's disease.}

  Methods: We performed a retrospective, observational cohort study in NHS
  Lothian including all UST treated CD patients (2015-2020).

  Results: 163 CD patients were treated with UST (median follow-up: 20.3 months
  [13.4-38.4]), of whom 55 (33.7%) underwent dose intensification to 4-weekly
  (n = 50, 30.7%) or 6-weekly (n = 5, 3.1%). After 1 year 29.9% were dose
  intensified. Prior exposure to both anti-TNF and vedolizumab (HR 9.5;
  1.3-70.9), and concomitant steroid use at UST start (HR 1.8; 1.0-3.1) were
  associated with dose intensification. Following dose intensification, 62.6%
  patients (29/55) remained on UST beyond 1 year. Corticosteroid-free clinical
  remission was achieved in 27% at week 16 and 29.6% at last follow-up.
  
  Conclusion: One third of CD patients treated with UST underwent dose
  intensification to a 4- or 6-weekly interval within the first year. Patients
  who failed both anti-TNF and vedolizumab, or required steroids at initiation
  were more likely to dose intensify.}

abstract = {Objective: It is unclear how the compounding prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has translated into the causes and rates of hospitalisation, particularly in an era of increased biologic prescribing. We aimed to analyse these trends in a population-based IBD cohort over the last 10 years. Design: The Lothian IBD registry is a complete, validated, prevalent database of IBD patients in NHS Lothian, Scotland. ICD-10 coding of hospital discharge letters from all IBD patient admissions to secondary care between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019 was interrogated for admission cause, with linkage to local/national data sets on death and prescribed drugs. Results: Fifty-seven per cent (4673/8211) of all IBD patients were admitted to secondary care for >24 h between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019. In patients <40 years, IBD was the commonest reason for admission (38\% of admissions), whereas infection was the most common cause in those >60 years (19\% of admissions). Three per cent (243/8211) of IBD patients accounted for 50\% of the total IBD bed-days over the study period. Age-standardised IBD admission rates fell from 39.4 to 25.5 admissions per 100,000 population between 2010 and 2019, an average annual percentage reduction of 3\% (95\% CI -4.5\% to -2.1\%, p < 0.0001). Non-IBD admission rates were unchanged overall (145-137 per 100,000 population) and specifically for serious (hospitalisation) and severe (ITU admission or death) infection over the same period. Conclusion: Despite compounding prevalence and increased biologic use, IBD admission rates are falling. The cause of admission varies with age, with infection the predominant cause in older patients.}
