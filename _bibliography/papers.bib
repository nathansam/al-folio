abstract = {Background:Long-term vedolizumab (VDZ) outcomes in real-world cohorts have been largely limited to 1-year follow-up, with few bio-naïve patients or objective markers of inflammation assessed.Objectives:We aimed to assess factors affecting VDZ persistence including clinical, biochemical and faecal biomarker remission at 1, 3 and 5 years.Design:We performed a retrospective, observational, cohort study.Methods:All adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients who had received VDZ induction for ulcerative colitis (UC)/IBD-unclassified (IBDU) were included. Baseline phenotype and follow-up data were collected via a review of electronic medical records.Results:We included 290 patients [UC n = 271 (93.4\%), IBDU n = 19 (6.6\%)] with a median time on VDZ of 27.6 months (interquartile range: 14.4-43.2). At the end of follow-up, a total of 157/290 (54.1\%) patients remained on VDZ. The median time to discontinuation was 14.1 months (7.0-23.3). Previous exposure to ⩾1 advanced therapy, steroid use at baseline and disease extension (E3 and E2 versus E1) were independent predictors for worse VDZ persistence. Clinical remission (partial Mayo < 2) was 75.7\% (171/226), 72.4\% (157/217) and 70.2\% (127/181) at years 1, 3 and 5, respectively. Steroid use during maintenance VDZ therapy occurred in 31.7\% (92/290), hospitalization in 15.5\% (45/290) and surgery in 3.4\% (10/291). The rate of serious adverse events was 1.2 per 100 patient-years of follow-up.Conclusion:VDZ effectiveness appears enduring with favourable long-term safety profile. VDZ persistence was influenced by previous exposure to biologics/small molecules, disease distribution and steroid use at baseline in our study.},

  abstract = {Background Upadacitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor, which has recently been approved for treating Crohn's disease. There are limited real-world studies on the outcomes of upadacitinib in Crohn's disease.
    Objective Our aim was to evaluate the outcomes of upadacitinib in a real-world Crohn's disease cohort.
    Methods We conducted a retrospective, multicentre, cohort study over a 2-year period across National Health Service (NHS) Lothian and Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. The primary outcome was treatment persistence at week 24. Secondary endpoints were corticosteroid-free clinical remission (Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI)<5) and biomarker remission (C-reactive protein (CRP)≤5 mg/L and faecal calprotectin (FCAL)<250 µg/g) at 12, 24 and 52 weeks. We recorded adverse events.
    Results 135 patients commenced upadacitinib as of the 1 January 2024, of which 93 patients with active Crohn's disease were included with a minimum of 12 weeks follow-up. The median follow-up time was 25 weeks (IQR 15-42 weeks). 82% of the cohort had exposure to at least two classes of advanced therapies, and 52% had exposure to at least three classes of advanced therapies. Treatment persistence was 87.1% at week 12, 81.7% at week 24 and 62.8% at week 52. Rates of clinical remission were 64% (42/66), 48% (22/46) and 38% (8/21) at weeks 12, 24 and 52, respectively. Significant reductions in HBI, CRP and FCAL were observed during follow-up. 14% (13/91) had a hospitalisation due to Crohn's disease. Adverse events occurred in 40% (37/93) of the cohort, of which 12% (11/93) were serious.
    Conclusion Upadacitinib was effective in a real-world, highly refractory, Crohn's disease cohort with good persistence.},

   abstract = {Background
   Filgotinib is a small molecule with preferential inhibition of Janus kinase type 1, approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in Scotland in May 2022. We present the first real world experience on its use in clinical practice.
   Methods
   In this retrospective, observational, cohort study we assessed patients with active ulcerative colitis who received filgotinib in NHS Lothian, Scotland. Baseline demographic, phenotype and follow-up data were collected via review of electronic medical records.
   Results
   We included 91 patients with median treatment duration of 39 weeks (IQR 23-49). Among the cohort, 67% (61/91) were biologic and small molecule naïve, whilst 20.9% (19/91) had failed one and 12.1% (11/91) ≥2 classes of advanced therapy. Of the biologic and small molecule naïve patients, 18% (11/61) were also thiopurine naïve. Clinical remission (partial Mayo score <2) was achieved in 71.9% (41/57) and 76.4% (42/55) of patients at weeks 12 and 24 respectively. Biochemical remission (CRP≤5mg/L) was achieved in 87.3% (62/71) at week 12 and 88.9% (40/45) at week 24. Faecal biomarker (calprotectin <250µg/g) remission was achieved in 82.8% (48/58) at week 12 and 79.5% (35/44) at week 24.

   At the end of follow-up, median 42 weeks (IQR 27-50), 82.4% (75/91) of patients remained on filgotinib. Severe adverse events leading to drug discontinuation occurred in 2.2% (2/91) and there were 8.8% (8/91) moderate adverse events that required temporary discontinuation.
   Conclusion
   These are the first reported data on the real-world efficacy and safety of filgotinib in ulcerative colitis. Our findings demonstrate that filgotinib is an effective and low risk treatment option for these patients.}

        abstract = {Abstract Background Switching from originator infliximab (IFX) to biosimilar IFX is effective and safe. However, data on multiple switching are scarce. The Edinburgh inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) unit has undertaken three switch programmes: (1) Remicade to CT-P13 (2016), (2) CT-P13 to SB2 (2020), and (3) SB2 to CT-P13 (2021). Objective The primary endpoint of this study was to assess CT-P13 persistence following switch from SB2. Secondary endpoints included persistence stratified by the number of biosimilar switches (single, double and triple), effectiveness and safety. Methods We performed a prospective, observational, cohort study. All adult IBD patients on IFX biosimilar SB2 underwent an elective switch to CT-P13. Patients were reviewed in a virtual biologic clinic with protocol driven collection of clinical disease activity, C-reactive protein (CRP), faecal calprotectin (FC), IFX trough/antibody levels, and drug survival. Results 297 patients (CD n = 196 [66\%], ulcerative colitis/inflammatory bowel disease unclassified n = 101, [34\%]) were switched (followed-up: 7.5 months [6.8–8.1]). This was the third, second and first IFX switch for 67/297 (22.5\%), 138/297 (46.5\%) and 92/297 (31\%) of the cohort respectively. 90.6\% of patients remained on IFX during follow-up. The number of switches was not independently associated with IFX persistence after adjusting for confounders. Clinical (p = 0.77), biochemical (CRP ≤5 mg/ml; p = 0.75) and faecal biomarker (FC<250 µg/g; p = 0.63) remission were comparable at baseline, week 12 and week 24. Conclusion Multiple successive switches from IFX originator to biosimilars are effective and safe in patients with IBD, irrespective of the number of IFX switches.}

abstract = {Background and aims: Tofacitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi)
recently approved for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis
(UC) based on robust efficacy and safety data derived from OCTAVE clinical
trials. Evidence on the outcomes of tofacitinib therapy in real-world UC
patients is needed, as a number of these patients would be deemed ineligible for
clinical trials. We have therefore summarised data derived from observational,
real-world evidence (RWE) studies on the effectiveness and safety of tofacitinib
in moderate to severe UC patients.
Methods: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane
databases for observational studies on the use of tofacitinib in UC patients,
published between 30 May 2018 and 24 January 2021. Pooled induction (8-14 weeks)
and maintenance (16-26 weeks) clinical response and remission rates were
calculated, as well as the proportion of reported adverse events using random
effects models.
Results: Nine studies were included, comprising 830 patients, of which 81\%
were previously treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and 57\% with
vedolizumab. Induction of clinical response and remission were achieved in 51\%
(95\% confidence interval, 41-60\%) and 37\% (26-45\%) of patients, after a
median follow-up of 8 weeks. At the end of a median follow-up of 24 weeks,
maintenance of clinical response and remission were met in 40\% (31-50\%) and
29\% (23-36\%) of patients, respectively. Thirty-two percent of the patients had
at least one adverse event, the most commonly reported being mild infection
(13\%) and worsening of UC, requiring colectomy (13\%). A third of the patients
(35\%) discontinued tofacitinib, most frequently due to primary non-response
(51\%). 
Conclusion: Tofacitinib is a safe and effective therapy in real-world UC
patients, as previously reported by clinical trials.}

[SB5-switch cohort] or after start of SB5 [SB5-start cohort].
Methods: We performed an observational cohort study in a tertiary IBD referral
centre. All IBD patients treated with Humira underwent an elective switch to
SB5. We identified all these patients in a biological prescription database that
prospectively registered all ADA start and stop dates including brand names.
Data on IBD phenotype, C-reactive protein [CRP], drug persistence, ADA drug and
antibody levels, and faecal calprotectin were collected.
Results: In total, 481 patients were treated with SB5, 256 in the SB5-switch
cohort (median follow-up: 13.7 months [IQR 8.6-15.2]) and 225 in the SB5-start
cohort [median follow-up: 8.3 months [4.2-12.8]). Of the SB5-switch cohort,
70.8% remained on SB5 beyond 1 year; 90/256 discontinued SB5, mainly due to
adverse events [46/90] or secondary loss of response [37/90]. In the SB5-start
cohort, 81/225 discontinued SB5, resulting in SB5-drug persistence of 60.3%
beyond 1 year. No differences in clinical remission [p = 0.53], CRP [p = 0.80],
faecal calprotectin [p = 0.40] and ADA trough levels [p = 0.55] were found
between baseline, week 26 and week 52 following switch. Injection site pain was
the most frequently reported adverse event.
Conclusion: Switching from ADA originator to SB5 appeared effective and safe in
this study with over 12 months of follow-up.}

abstract = {Background and Aims
  The progressive nature of Crohn's disease is highly variable and hard to predict. In addition, symptoms correlate poorly with mucosal inflammation. There is therefore an urgent need to better characterize the heterogeneity of disease trajectories in Crohn’s disease by utilizing objective markers of inflammation. We aimed to better understand this heterogeneity by clustering Crohn’s disease patients with similar longitudinal fecal calprotectin profiles.
  Methods
  We performed a retrospective cohort study at the Edinburgh IBD Unit, a tertiary referral center, and used latent class mixed models to cluster Crohn’s disease subjects using fecal calprotectin observed within five years of diagnosis. Information criteria, alluvial plots, and cluster trajectories were used to decide the optimal number of clusters. Chi-squared, Fisher’s exact test, and ANOVA were used to test for associations with variables commonly assessed at diagnosis.
  Results
  Our study cohort comprised of 365 patients with newly diagnosed Crohn’s disease and 2856 fecal calprotectin measurements taken within five years of diagnosis (median 7 per subject). Four distinct clusters were identified by characteristic calprotectin profiles: a cluster with consistently high fecal calprotectin and three clusters characterized by different downward longitudinal trends. Cluster membership was significantly associated with smoking (p = 0.015), upper gastrointestinal involvement (p < 0.001), and early biologic therapy (p < 0.001).
  Conclusions
  Our analysis demonstrates a novel approach to characterizing the heterogeneity of Crohn’s disease by using fecal calprotectin. The group profiles do not simply reflect different treatment regimens and do not mirror classical disease progression endpoints.}

We aimed to analyse these trends in a population-based IBD cohort over the last 10 years. Design: The Lothian IBD registry is a complete, validated, prevalent database of IBD patients in NHS Lothian, Scotland. ICD-10 coding of hospital discharge letters from all IBD patient admissions to secondary care between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019 was interrogated for admission cause, with linkage to local/national data sets on death and prescribed drugs. Results: Fifty-seven per cent (4673/8211) of all IBD patients were admitted to secondary care for >24 h between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019. In patients <40 years, IBD was the commonest reason for admission (38\% of admissions), whereas infection was the most common cause in those >60 years (19\% of admissions). Three per cent (243/8211) of IBD patients accounted for 50\% of the total IBD bed-days over the study period. Age-standardised IBD admission rates fell from 39.4 to 25.5 admissions per 100,000 population between 2010 and 2019, an average annual percentage reduction of 3\% (95\% CI -4.5\% to -2.1\%, p < 0.0001). Non-IBD admission rates were unchanged overall (145-137 per 100,000 population) and specifically for serious (hospitalisation) and severe (ITU admission or death) infection over the same period. Conclusion: Despite compounding prevalence and increased biologic use, IBD admission rates are falling. The cause of admission varies with age, with infection the predominant cause in older patients.}
