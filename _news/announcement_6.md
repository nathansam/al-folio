My thesis was examined by 
[Dr Chris Lamb](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/christopherlamb.html),
[Dr Ailith Ewing](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/dr-ailith-ewing), and 
[Dr Brian Tom](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/t-to-z/brian-tom/). 

I was jointly supervised by Dr Catalina Vallejos and Dr Karla Monterrubio
in the [Vallejos group](https://vallejosgroup.github.io/) and by
[Professor Charlie Lees](https://charlielees.com/). My work focused on exploring
heterogeneity in characterising heterogeneity in IBD by clustering
subjects based upon longitudinal biomarker profiles (faecal calprotectin and
CRP).

I am now continuing to work in the Lees and Vallejos groups as a
postdoctoral research associate, continuing my ongoing research.
